# Brainstorming_Paper

Intelligent computer systems increasingly take on more tasks
of humans, even in the context of creativity techniques. After an overview
of current research approaches of support potentials of electronic creativity
techniques and virtual moderators, this paper introduces natural language
processing techniques to analyze brainstorming sessions. On this
foundation, an artifact is developed that is able to generate mind maps in
virtually real-time during electronic brainstorming sessions. The objective
is to show mentioned terms to motivate the participants to continue
own or foreign ideas and make user behavior visible.
